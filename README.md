# Predator-Prey-relationship-and-Species-Competition-Simulation-using-Runge-Kutta-RK-methods
Explore predator-prey dynamics and species competition with Python code implementing Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. This repository includes RK-2 and RK-4 implementations for both predator-prey and species competition models. Jupyter Notebooks visualize simulation results and compare execution times.
